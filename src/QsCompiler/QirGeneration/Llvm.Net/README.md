# Llvm.NET Dependency

These binaries are from [UbiquityDotNET Llvm.NET](https://github.com/UbiquityDotNET/Llvm.NET) project, which defines a .NET wrapper around the native LLVM APIs. They are cached here in order to utilize the version that has cross-platform support. This work is in-progress and tracked by [Issue #193](https://github.com/UbiquityDotNET/Llvm.NET/issues/193) at that repository. Once #493 is resolved and cross-platform support included in a published package, these binaries can be removed in favor of a package reference. Please refer to that project and issue for details and to contribute to the project.

The ArgValidator dll matches the [Arg.Validator 6.0.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ubiquity.ArgValidators) NuGet package. It is checked in as binary here instead of being a proper package reference for code signing purposes only.
